Python - Spring 2012
Final Project


HOW TO RUN:
Run the command line game with:
python play.py


EXPLANATION OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION:

Main Module
The main module for our game is play.py, while connect4.py contains all function and object definitions. Within connect4.py, the objects that are defined are Game, PLayer, AIPlayer, 
When play.py is executed, an instance of Game is initialized.  

When the game is initialized, the program asks the user to select a human or computer player for Player 1 (who will be represented in the game with "x") and Player 2 (represented with "o"). The user may select for human vs human, human vs computer, and even computer vs computer. The user also is asked to name each player. For each human player, an instance of Player is initialized and for each computer player, an instance of AIPlayer is initialized.
